        <ul>
            <li>
                Low in maintenance – When it comes to maintenance, UPVC windows are low in
                <br>
                maintenance. Since they are made up of unplasticised vinyl polymer, they are
                <br>
                easy to maintain and do not burn a huge hole in your pocket.

            title: "How long do UPVC windows last for?",
            description: `UPVC windows, also known as vinyl windows, are known for their durability and
            longevity. On average, well-maintained UPVC windows can last for approx 20-30 years.
            However, their lifespan can vary depending on various factors such as the quality of the
            materials used, the installation method, the climate conditions, and the level of
            maintenance. Here are some factors that can affect the lifespan of UPVC windows:
            
            1. Quality: High-quality UPVC windows tend to have better resistance to UV rays,
            discolouration, and warping which can prolong their lifespan.
            2. Installation: Proper installation is crucial for the long-term performance of UPVC
            windows. Improper installations can lead to issues like air leaks, water
            infiltration, and structural problems that may reduce their lifespan.
            3. Maintenance: Regular cleaning and maintenance can help expand the lifespan of
            UPVC windows. This includes cleaning the frames, lubricating moving parts, and
            ensuring that the weather-stripping and seals are intact.
            4. Climate: UPVC windows are known for their resistance to various weather
            conditions, including harsh sunshine, seasonal rains, and temperature
            fluctuations. However, extreme climates or exposure to severe weather events
            can potentially reduce their lifespan.`,

        {
            title: "What are the different types of UPVC windows that one can choose from?",
            description: `UPVC.expert has a number of styles in UPVC windows that one can choose from based
            on one’s preference, budget, and requirements. Here are some common types;
            1. Casement Windows: Casement windows are hinged at the side and open
            outward like a door. They offer excellent ventilation and can be easily opened
            and closed with a crank door. Casement windows are versatile and suitable for
            various architectural styles.
            2. Sliding Windows: Sliding windows consists of two or more horizontal sashes that
            slide past each other. They are easy to operate and provide a wide view when
            fully opened. Sliding windows are a popular choice for contemporary homes and
            spaces with limited exterior clearance.
            3. Awning Windows: Awning windows are hinged at the top and open outward,
            creating a small ‘awning’ effect. They are often used in combination with other
            window styles or placed together on walls to allow for ventilation while
            maintaining privacy and protection from external factors.
            4. Bay Windows: Bay windows are a combination of three or more windows that
            project outward from the wall, creating a curved or angular shape. They add an
            architectural interest to a room, increase natural light, and offer expansive views.
            Bay windows typically have a larger central fixed window, while bow windows
            have multiple operable windows.
            5. Tilt and Turn Windows: These windows offer versatility and functionality. They
            can be opened inward from the side like a casement window or tilted from the
            top for ventilation. This design allows for easy cleaning and provides various
            options for airflow control.
            6. Fixed Windows: Also known as picture windows, they do not open or close as
            they are fixed in nature. They are designed to let natural light and provide
            unobstructed views. Fixed windows are commonly used in combination with
            other window types to create larger window configurations.
            7. Sash Windows: Sash windows have one or more movable panels, called sashes,
            which slide vertically to open and close. They are often found in traditional or
            historical buildings and offer a classic, elegant look.
            Each window has their own advantages and features, so it’s important to consider your
            specific requirements and consult our professionals to determine the most suitable
            option for your home or project.`,

            title: "What kind of maintenance do UPVC windows require?",
            description: `<p>
            UPVC windows are relatively low-maintenance compared to other types of windows.
            <br>
            However, regular care and maintenance can help ensure their optimal performance and
            <br>
            longevity. Here are some of the maintenance tasks that one can consider for UPVC
            <br>
            windows.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Cleaning: Clean your UPVC windows regularly to remove dirt, dust, and grease
                <br>
                that might have settled over a period of time. Use a mild soap detergent or an
                <br>
                UPVC cleaner mixed with water and a soft cloth or sponge to clean the frames
                <br>
                and the glass. Avoid using abrasive materials or any form of harsh chemicals that
                <br>
                could damage the UPVC surfaces or window seals.
            </li>
            <li>
                Lubrication: Periodically, lubricate the moving parts of the UPVC windows like
                <br>
                hinges, handles, cranks, and locks to ensure smooth operation. Use a silicone-
                <br>
                based lubricant or a recommended UPVC lubricant. Be sure to follow the
                <br>
                manufacturer’s instructions and avoid applying excessive amounts of lubricants.
            </li>
            <li>
                Check Seals &amp; Weather-stripping: Check and inspect the seals and weather-
                <br>
                stripping around your UPVC windows. Over time, these components can wear
                <br>
                out or become damaged, leading to drafts and energy loss. Replace any worn or
                <br>
                damaged seals to maintain proper insulation and prevent air or water leaks.
            </li>
            <li>
                Adjust &amp; tighten the hardware: Check for the hardware components like hinges,
                <br>
                handles, locks, and cranks for proper alignment and tightness. If you notice any
                <br>
                loose or misaligned parts, tighten them or consult an expert for adjustments. This
                <br>
                will ensure that the windows operate smoothly and securely.
            </li>
            <li>
                Inspect the glass panels: Inspect the glass panels occasionally for any cracks,
                <br>
                damages, or chips. If you notice any issues, consider reaching out to an UPVC
                <br>
                expert to address the issues promptly.

            title: "Are UPVC Windows Safe?",
            description: `UPVC windows are considered safe because of their multi-point, high-security locks. The
            locks are generally fitted into the core steel portion of the window frame making the
            UPVC windows air-tight. Not only are they challenging to break, they also enhance
            sound insulation as well as thermal insulation in homes. Additionally, the UPVC is
            naturally a fire-retardant material. In case of a fire accident, unlike wood, it will not act
            as fuel to the fire. An UPVC windows manufacturer normally integrates double glazed
            glasses. You can further use security systems like intruder alarms to increase the safety
            aspects of your windows.`,
        },
        {
            title: "Are UPVC Windows fire retardant?",
            description: `Since UPVC does not burn as quickly as wood and has high thermal insulation, it is
            considered as a fire retardant. The material is considered to be safe because of its self-
            extinguishing properties. If there is an accident leading to fire break-up, UPVC will not
            burn nor act as an insulator to spread the flames.`,

            Yes, experts agree that UPVC windows are better than wood for the following reasons.

        </p>
        <ul>

                wipe. In case of staining, one can use mild cleaning agent with a damp cloth.
